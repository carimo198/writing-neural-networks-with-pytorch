    "\n",
    "When working with sequences ), each element of the input is referred to as a **token**. In Natural Language Processing (NLP) a token represents a word, or a component of a word. Tokenization is a fundamental step in NLP, where given a character sequence and a defined document unit, it will break up and separate the sequence into discrete elements (tokens). Therefore, tokens can take the form of words, characters, or sub-words. There are libraries such as *spaCy*, that can provide complex solutions to tokenization. \n",

When applying dropout, the dropout layer will temporarily disconnect some of the units inputs and outputs from the previous layer. Once the batch is completed, these units and all of their connections are restored. At the beginning of the next batch, a new random set of units are temporarily removed with this process repeating itself for each epoch. Dropout can delay overfitting as it prevents any unit from over-specialising on the training data. \n",

This is achieved by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the network weights to remain small. Weight decay indicates a Gaussian prior over the model parameters resulting in regularisation of the networks complexity (Graves 2011).\n",

This allows us to experiment with different hyperparameters and choose the best ones based on their performance on the validation set and help improve generalisation. Once the optimal parameters where found and we were confident that the model can generalise, the network was run on the complete training dataset.

The higher this score, the worse the network's prediction is. For tasks such as regression, MSE cost is preferred. However, it has a vital flaw in which neuron saturation can occur. This can negatively impact neural networks ability to learn. An alternative cost function is cross-entropy which is well suited to classification tasks. Cross-entropy loss function estimates the probability of a predicted label belonging to the target class label and leads to faster learning as well improved generalisation for classification problems. \n",

To convert the subsequent output probabilities into two discrete classes, we can apply a decision boundary of 0.5. If the predicted probability is above 0.5, the predicted class is 1 (positive); otherwise the class is 0 (negative). The decision boundary value can also be tuned as a hyperparameter to achieve the desired accuracy.  \n",
