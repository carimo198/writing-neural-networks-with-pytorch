    "Training and fine tuning the hyperparameters were performed by setting *trainValSplit* to 0.85. This allowed for confidence in the generalisation of our model as we could test the model's performance on the validation set and adjust hyperparameter values accordingly. To finalise learning on the training dataset, *trainValSplit* was set to 0.99 to ensure our model is trained on as many data as possible. Increase in training data greatly improves the models overall performance which significantly improved accuracy in classifying business categories. \n",
