# Writing Neural Networks: Language processing with PyTorch
## Building a BiLSTM model for the analysis of business review texts
### [Report: Writing neural networks with PyTorch](https://carimo198.github.io/writing-neural-networks-with-pytorch/intro.html) 

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how to build and implement a biLSTM recurrent neural network with PyTorch. 
I had built the network as part of my Master of Data Science university project for the *Neural Network, Deep Learning* subject at UNSW, Sydney.
For this project we were required to write a Pytorch program that learns to read business reviews in text format and predict a rating (positive or negative) associated with each review, as well as a business category (0=Restaurants, 1=Shopping, 2=Home Services, 3=Health & Medical, 4=Automotive). Please refer to [report link](https://carimo198.github.io/writing-neural-networks-with-pytorch/intro.html) in which I have outline how the program works with explanation behind my design decisions.

The file student.py is completed to run in conjunction with a3main.py by typing the following command line in the terminal:

python3 a3main.py
