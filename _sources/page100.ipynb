We have also set *include_length=True* to allow for dynamic padding by adding the lengths of the reviews to the dataset. In addition to the *Field* object, a *preprocessing()* function has been defined in *student.py* to perform the following additional preprocessing of the data using the regular expression package, *re*:\n",

    "The model uses Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe 6B) unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representation for words (Pennington et al. 2014). GloVe is used for word embedding for text where it allows for words with similar meaning to have similar representation. The dimension of the vector was chosen to be 300 as the increase in dimension allows the vector to capture more information. For this task, dimension of 300 was found to perform better when we experimented with different dimension values (50, 150, 200, 250). However, it should be noted that increases in dimension size will result in greater computational complexity. "

    "Our model uses sigmoid activation function which outputs *FloatTensor* data type values between 0 and 1 to predict ratings. In this sentiment analysis task, our model is required to predict whether the review texts are negative or positive. Therefore, the ratings prediction is a binary classification task where it only requires to take on the value of 0 (negative) or 1 (positive). We can thus ensure the prediction label for *ratingOutput* is in *LongTensor* data type by applying the following process:\n",

Our model uses the *CrossEntropyLoss()* loss function, which combines log softmax loss function and negative log-likelihood and outputs a probability distribution between 0 and 1. Therefore, the predicted label with the highest probability was assigned to the target class by applying the following conversion process:\n",

Subsequently, the *torch.argmax()* function will return the indices of the maximum values of the category prediction output tensor in LongTensor data type representing the label with the highest probability (Paszke et al. 2019).
